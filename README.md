Python exercises

## [Exercise 00](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es00.py)
Print "Hello World!" in five different ways.

## [Exercise 01](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es01.py)
Given a dictionary:
```
D = {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2}
```
Print the record list by rearranging the keys:
```
a => 1
b => 2
c => 3
```

## [Exercise 02](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es02.py)
Use a for loop to iterate through the word "spam" in order to obtain the sequence:
```
spam pams amsp mspa
```

## [Exercise 03](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es03.py)
Consider the string "abcdefghijk", list the odd character by using `len()` and `range()` and list the even character using indexing and slicing.
The output should be:
```
a c e g i k
b d f h j
```

## [Exercise 04](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es04.py)
Write a program that calculates the number of characters in a string entered from the command line.

Entering for example the string "abcdefgabc", the program must generate:
```
a,2
c,2
b,2
e,1
d,1
g,1
f,1
```

## [Exercise 05](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es05.py)
Write a program that can check whether any number (entered from the keyboard) is prime or not.

## [Exercise 06](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es06.py)
List the *.c* and *.h* files found in the directory.

## [Exercise 07](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es07.py)
Create a program that make a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide using functions.

## [Exercise 08](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es08.py)
Repeat the exercise 07 but now use lambda functions.

## [Exercise 09](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es09.py)
Write a Python program to convert 20 int random number (form 0 to 2000) to a roman numeral.
Define three functions:
- **symbolDefInit()**: definition of GLOBAL symbols
- **generateRandomInteger()**: return random int
- **conversionToRoman(intNum)**: return roman num

Table:
```
I = 1
V = 5
X = 10
L = 50
C = 100
D = 500
M = 1000
```

## [Exercise 10](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es10.py)
Given the date of "2018-05-12" print the time difference with today's date.

## [Exercise 11](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es11.py)
Shows that a local variable cannot be seen outside the function in which it is declared but exclusively inside it.

## [Exercise 12](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es12.py)
Shows that a nonlocal variable can also be modified by an internal function.

## [Exercise 13](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es13.py)
Print a list of all files and a list of the *.c* and *.h* files of the *./work* directory.

## [Exercise 14](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es14.py)
Print the string "The Lord of the Rings" for a random number of times from 1 to 20.

## [Exercise 15](https://github.com/RiccardoCuccu/py/blob/master/exercises/es15.py)
Read and print the *./work/main.c* file three times using the `read()`, `readline()` and `readlines()` functions.
