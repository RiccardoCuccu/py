Python exercises

## Exercise 00

## Exercise 01
Given a dictionary:
```

```
Print the record list by rearranging the keys:
```
a => 1
b => 2
c => 3
```

## Exercise 02
Use a for loop to iterate through the word "spam" in order to obtain the sequence:
```
spam pams amsp mspa
```

## Exercise 03
Consider the string "abcdefghijk", list the odd character by using len and range and list the even character using indexing and slicing.
The output should be:
```
a c e g i k
b d f h j
```

## Exercise 04
Write a program that calculates the number of characters in a string entered from the command line.

Entering for example the string "abcdefgabc", the program must generate:
```
a,2
c,2
b,2
e,1
d,1
g,1
f,1
```

## Exercise 05
Write a program that can check whether any number (entered from the keyboard) is prime or not.

## Exercise 06

## Exercise 07
Create a program that make a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide using functions.

## Exercise 08
Repeat the exercise 07 but now use lambda functions.

## Exercise 09
Write a Python program to convert 20 int random number (form 0 to 2000) to a roman numeral.
Define three functions:
- **symbolDefInit()**: definition of GLOBAL symbols
- **generateRandomInteger()**: return random int
- **conversionToRoman(intNum)**: return roman num

Table:
```
I = 1
V = 5
X = 10
L = 50
C = 100
D = 500
M = 1000
```

## Exercise 10
Given the date of "2018-05-12" print the time difference with today's date.

## Exercise 11
Shows that a local variable cannot be seen outside the function in which it is declared but exclusively inside it.
